  <h1>A to Z Wk 1</h1>
  <h3>Sep 14, 2021</h3>
  
  <p>This is my first assignment for class A to Z. For this assignment, I created a new "constrained writing" technique which I would call it Pie Spacing.<p>
  <p>I’m very new to html and github. It's so exciting I'm creating my first html website!!! yay!!!</p>
  <p><strong>So for Pie Spacing, the rules are as follows:</strong> </p>
  <p>1. Delete all the spaces and punctuation in the text</p>
  <p>2. Lowercase all the letters</p>
  <p>3. Insert a new space after every digit of pie letters (3.1415926535897932384626433832…)</p>
  <p>- So after three letters, insert a space. And after one letter, insert another space. Then after four letters, insert a space…</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <p>Original text:</p>
