### Lyrics Word Frequency Analysis

* Try my sketch here https://editor.p5js.org/Siro1998/sketches/x7KjeYqax
* For wk4 assignment, I created a collage with words from lyrics. I found a dataset that includes 745 popular English songs lyrics from artists like Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, David Bowie, etc... and save the lyrics as a txt file.

* I used the inclass word counting example to count the frequence of each word.

* I let the word appear randomly on the canvas, and I mapped the frequency to size of the words.

* Words like "the", "a", "I" appears most frequently in lyrics like all the other text files. But words like "love" "oh" also appears a lot in lyrics. Singers like to sing about love. LOL.

Here is a video demo.
